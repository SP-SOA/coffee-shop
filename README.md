# Virtual Coffee Shop Simulator

A Python exercise to show how Python can be utilized to implement a real-world scenario -  this application simulates the operation of a coffee shop, demonstrating the use of functions, data structures, and basic user interaction in Python. 

## Features

- **Menu Display:** Users can view the available coffee options along with their prices.
- **Order Customization:** Customers can choose the type of coffee they want, specify the quantity, and select their preferred milk option (Oat or Soy).
- **Inventory Check:** The application checks if there's enough inventory to fulfill the order.
- **Payment Processing:** Users are prompted to enter their payment, and the application handles insufficient or excess payment scenarios gracefully.
- **Customer Feedback:** After completing the order, customers can rate their experience and leave a tip if they wish.

## Main Component 

- `main.py`: Contains the main logic for the coffee shop operation. It includes:
  - Inventory management
  - Menu and pricing
  - Recipes for each coffee type
  - Functions to display the menu, take orders, check inventory, update inventory, process payments, and handle customer feedback

## Getting Started
